# UpRoll CLI Tool

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

The **UpRoll CLI Tool** by Upnode enables chain operators and developers to efficiently configure and deploy OP Stack chains. You can create a chain configuration either through our [website](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/) or directly via the CLI.


Deployment is handled through the CLI. After building your chain using the website, deployment is as easy as running:
 ```
 uproll deploy -i [config_id]
 ```


For deployment, UpRoll uses a fork of the [optimism package](https://github.com/zapper-95/optimism-package) which provides greater levels of customisation. Unlike Conduit, which is a paid, closed-source solution that relies on third-party managed servers, UpRoll CLI Tool is free, open-source, and allows developers to deploy OP Stack chains on their own infrastructure with full transparency.



## Requirements
To run the CLI, you will first need to make sure you have the following programs:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18 or higher and [Node package management](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) version 27 or higher
- [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install) latest version


**Install UpRoll CLI Tool**

```console
npm install -g @upnode/uproll-cli
```

**Verify version**

```console
uproll version
```

**Update version**

```console
npm update -g @upnode/uproll-cli
```


## Creating and Deploying a Chain

### Website + CLI

Our website allows you to create and store rollup configurations, which can then be used for deployment via the CLI.




#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
  1.  **Sign up** and navigate to the [Create Your Rollup](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/config) page
  2. Configure your chain settings and click **Save**
  3. Your configuration will be assigned a unique **configuration ID**

#### 2. Deploy Your Chain
To deploy your saved configuration, run:
```
uproll deploy -i [config_id]
```
Replace `config_id` with your chain's unique configuration ID.

You will then be prompted for the project name. Once entered, the chain configuration will be deployed.
### CLI Only
#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
Run the following command:
```
uproll run
```
Select **Deploy Rollup** from the menu.

You will then be prompted for values for various parameters. After confirming your selections, a valid configuration file will be generated automatically.

#### 2. Deploy your Chain
Deployment begins automatically once the configuration file is created. Alternatively, if you already have a configuration file, you can deploy it directly by running `uproll deploy -f [path/config.yaml]`



## Other Menu Options
All other menu options can be accessed by running:

```
uproll run
```

### Stop Rollup

This option stops a specific rollup from running and deletes its project folder. Since Kurtosis does not support restarting an enclave after stopping it, the rollup and its associated project folder are removed.

### Chain Info

After deployment, chain information is saved to a chain's project folder. 

The **Chain info** command retrieves files related to a rollup's deployment, such as `intent.toml` and `wallets.json` or its genesis file.

A list of active rollups is displayed. After selecting one, a list of available files appears. The chosen file is then displayed.

### Status of the deployment

This command displays the deployment status of a rollup, including each service.

### View logs

This command displays the log files of a particular rollup after it has been deployed.

### Clean

Kurtosis runs multiple Docker containers for each deployed chain, which can significantly impact your computerâ€™s performance.

If you no longer need to run any chains, use the following command to stop and remove them.

**Note:** This will permanently delete their project folders, including all configuration files and logs.
