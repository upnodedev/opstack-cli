# UpRoll CLI Tool

<!-- <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jWynfrz/Imgur-Magic.gif" alt="Imgur-Magic" border="0"></a> -->

The **UpRoll CLI Tool** by Upnode enables chain operators and developers to efficiently configure and deploy OP Stack chains. You can create a chain configuration either through our [website](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/) or directly via the CLI.

Deployment is handled through the CLI. If you're using a chain from the website run
 ```
 run uproll deploy -i [config_id]
 ```
Otherwise, deployment happens automatically after building the chain via the CLI.

For deployment, UpRoll uses a fork of the [optimism package](https://github.com/zapper-95/optimism-package) which provides greater levels of customisation. Unlike Conduit, which is a paid, closed-source solution that relies on third-party managed servers, UpRoll CLI Tool is free, open-source, and allows developers to deploy OP Stack chains on their own infrastructure with full transparency.


<!-- ## How to use -->
<!-- [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JKe9q2z09XA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKe9q2z09XA) -->

## Requirements
To run the CLI, you will first need to make sure you have the following programs:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18 or higher and [Node package management](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) version 27 or higher
- [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install)


**Install UpRoll CLI Tool**

```console
$ npm install -g @upnode/UpRoll-cli
```

**Verify version**

```console
$ uproll version
```

**Update version**

```console
$ npm update -g @upnode/UpRoll-cli
```

## Quick Start

To start the CLI for the first time you need to run the following command:

```console
$ uproll run
```
A folder will then be created in your home directory called `UpRoll`. This is where all files relating to your rollups will be stored.

The [optimism-package](https://github.com/zapper-95/optimism-package), which handles deployment, will also be cloned to this directory.

## Creating and Deploying a Chain

### Website + CLI

Our website allows you to create and store rollup configurations, which can then be used for deployment via the CLI.

#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
  1.  **Sign up** and navigate to the [Create Your Rollup](https://uproll-web.vercel.app/config) page
  2. Configure your chain settings and click **Save**
  3. Your configuration will be assigned a unique **configuration ID**

#### 2. Deploy Your Chain
To deploy your saved configuration, run:
```
uproll deploy -i [config_id]
```
Replace `config_id` with your chain's unique configuration ID.

You will then be prompted for the project name. Once provided the chain configuration will be deployed.
### Only CLI
#### 1. Create a Rollup Configuration
Run the following command:
```
$ uproll run

=> Deploy Rollup
```

You will then be prompted for values for various parameters. After confirming your selections, a valid configuration file will be generated automatically.

### 2. Deploy your Chain
Once the configuration file is created, deployment will begin automatically.

## Stop Rollup

This command stops a specific rollup and deletes its project folder. Since Kurtosis does not support restarting an enclave after stopping it, the rollup and its associated project folder are removed.
```
ops run
=> Stop rollup
```


## Chain Info

After deployment, chain information is saved to a chains project folder. 

The **Chain info** command retrieves files relating to a rollup's deployment, such as `intent.toml` and `wallets.json` or its genesis file.
```
ops run
=> Chain Info
```
A list of active rollups is displayed. After selecting one, a list of available files appears. The chosen file is then displayed.

## Status of the deployment

This command displays the deployment status of a rollup including each service

```
ops run
=> Status of the deployment
```

## View logs

This command displays the log files of particular rollup, after it has been deployed.

```
ops run
=> Views logs
```


## Clean

Kurtosis runs multiple Docker containers for each deployed chain, which can significantly impact your computerâ€™s performance.

If you no longer need to run any chains, use the following command to stop and remove them.

Note: This will permanently delete their project folders, including all configuration files and logs.
```
ops run
=> Clean
```
